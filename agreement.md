# Cross-License Collaborative Agreement

## Purpose

These terms enable contributors working together on a project subject to copyright or patent law to make collective decisions about licensing the project as a whole.

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must be invited to become a contributor and agree to these terms.  Those terms are both strict obligations under an agreement among all contributors and conditions to all the cross-licenses you receive.

## Cross-Licenses

### Copyright

Each contributor grants a cross-license covering all copyrights in their contributions to this project to each other contributor.

### Patent

Each contributor grants a cross-license for this project covering any patent claims they can license or become able to license to each other contributor.

### Trademark

Each contributor grants a cross-license covering any trademark rights they have in the software to each other contributor.

### Scope

Each cross-license under these terms covers all contributors, past, present, and future, and all contributions submitted to the project, past, present, and future.

### Rights

Cross-licenses under these terms do not gives contributors themselves any special permission to do what copyright, patent, trademark, or other licenses for the project that apply to them prohibit.  Rather, cross-licenses under these terms only enable contributors to sublicense others.

### Sublicensing

Any contributor may grant a sublicense for which they have secured [majority approval](#majority).  When [soliciting votes](#soliciting-votes) for a sublicense, a contributor must [communicate](#communications):

1.  the identity of the contributor proposing to grant the sublicense

2.  an exact copy of all the proposed sublicense terms

3.  the identities of the sublicense recipient or recipients

Contributors may sublicense specific license recipients, classes of license recipients, or the public as a whole.  Sublicenses may allow sublicensing in turn.  Sublicenses must apply from the time of approval going forward, or from a time stated in the terms, not retroactively.

## Contributors

### Qualifications

Only candidates offering to contribute copyrights, patent rights, or trademark rights that would be covered by a cross-license can become contributors.

### Application

To become a contributor, a candidate must provide the following to an existing contributor:

1.  an [address](#addresses) for [communication](#communications) 

2.  a World Wide Web or other Internet address where contributors can review the contribution they are offering

### Approval

An existing contributor must secure [majority approval](#majority) in favor of a contributor application.  When [soliciting votes](#soliciting-votes) for a new contributor application, the soliciting contributor must [communicate](#communications) the addresses [provided by the candidate](#application).

### Resignation

Any contributor may resign as a contributor at any time by [communicating](#communications) their resignation.  When a contributor resigns, all cross-licenses to that contributor terminate, but their cross-licenses to other contributors, as well as any sublicenses they granted, continue.

## Communications

### Equal Information

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive each message sent under these terms.  Any sublicense that entitles any contributor to receive a message must entitle each contributor to receive that message.

### Sending

To send a communication under these terms, a contributor must send and [retry](#retry) the message to each other contributor.

### Addresses

The first contributor's address for communication must be addresses for delivery via a global, free or low-cost, high-speed, and written communication system, such as e-mail.  Later contributors' addresses must be addresses for delivery via the same system.

### Change of Address

Any contributor may set a new address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communication) the new address from their current address.  Alternatively, any contributor may set a new address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communications) the new address from a different address and securing [supermajority approval](#supermajority) in favor of using the new address, without any opposing message from the address to be replaced.

## Voting

### Equal Vote

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to cast a single, equal vote on each proposal under these terms.  Any sublicense that entitles any contributor a vote on any proposal must entitle each contributor an equal vote on that proposal.

### Majority

For majority approval, a majority of all responding contributors must vote in favor.

### Supermajority Vote

For supermajority approval, two thirds of all responding contributors must vote in favor.

## Counting

The contributor soliciting approval counts as a contributor responding in favor.

### Deadline

The deadline for approval of any proposal is thirty calendar days from when [votes were first solicited](#soliciting-votes).

### Voting Process

To secure an approval, a contributor must [solicit votes](#soliciting-votes), then [tally votes](#tallying-votes), and finally [report the result](#reporting-results).

### Soliciting Votes

To solicit votes, a contributor must communicate:

1.  the identity of the project

2.  the complete text of the proposal

3.  the voting standard required

4.  the [deadline](#deadline) as a specific date

### Voting

Contributors may vote by replying to a solicitation using the same system of communication.  Messages like "I approve.", "I vote in favor.", and "Aye" indicate a vote in favor.  Messages like "I oppose.", "I vote against.", and "Nay" indicate a vote against.

### Tallying Votes

To tally votes, the contributor who solicited the votes must ensure that each vote message is communicated to all contributors.  If the communication system enables forwarding messages verbatim, such as by forwarding e-mail, the contributor must forward vote messages verbatim.  If a voting contributor communicates their vote themself, the contributor soliciting votes does not have to communicate it again.

### Reporting Results

To report a result, the contributor who solicited the votes must communicate all the following within seven calendar days after the [deadline](#deadline):

1.  all the information required to [solicit votes](#soliciting-votes)

2.  copies of all [vote messages](#voting)

3.  counts of votes in favor, votes against, and contributors not responding within the [deadline](#deadline)

4.  whether contributors approved the proposal or not

## Payments

### Equal Pay

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive an equal share of payment made under these terms.  Any sublicense that entitles any contributor to pay must entitle each contributor to an equal share.

### Accounting

### Process

<!-- TODO: net out payment processing fees -->

<!-- TODO: retry, if not responding, redistribute -->

### Distribution

<!-- TODO -->

## Retry

When a [communication](#communications) or [payment](#payments) system fails to deliver a message or payment as undeliverable, to an unknown address or account, or the like, the sending contributor must:

1.  [communicate](#communications) the failure and any message from the system

2.  wait 48 hours, then send again

3.  if the second attempt fails, [communicate](#communications) the final failure and any message from the system

On final failure to respond, the contributor is considered to be not responding for the communication or payment.

## Amendments

Any contributor may amend these terms by securing [supermajority approval](#supermajority) of the amended terms.  Amendments may only apply from the time of approval going forward, not retroactively.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this project comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to any other contributor for any damages related to this project or these terms, under any kind of legal claim.***
