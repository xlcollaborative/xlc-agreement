# Cross-License Collaborative Agreement

Development Draft

## Purpose

These terms enable contributors working together on a project subject to copyright or patent law to make collective decisions about licensing the project as a whole.

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must become a contributor and agree to these terms.  Those terms are both strict obligations under an agreement among all contributors and conditions to all the cross-licenses you receive.

## Cross-Licenses

### Copyright

Each contributor grants a cross-license covering all copyrights in their contributions to this project to each other contributor.

### Patent

Each contributor grants a cross-license for this project covering any patent claims they can license or become able to license to each other contributor.

### Scope

Each cross-license under these terms covers all contributors, past, present, and future, and all contributions submitted to the project, past, present, and future.

### Rights

Cross-licenses under these terms do not give contributors themselves any special permission for the project, only to sublicense.

### Sublicensing

Any contributor may grant a sublicense for which they have secured [majority approval](#majority).  When [soliciting votes](#soliciting-votes) for a sublicense, a contributor must [communicate](#communications):

1.  identification of the contributor proposing to grant the sublicense

2.  an exact copy of all the proposed sublicense terms

3.  identification of the recipient or recipients of the sublicense

Contributors may sublicense specific license recipients, classes of license recipients, or the public as a whole.  Sublicenses may allow sublicensing in turn.  Sublicenses must apply from the time of approval going forward, or from a time stated in the terms, not retroactively.

## Contributors

### Qualifications

Only candidates offering to contribute copyrights or patent rights that would be covered by a cross-license can become contributors.

### Application

To become a contributor, a candidate must provide the following to an existing contributor:

1.  an [address](#addresses) for [communication](#communications) 

2.  a World Wide Web or other Internet address where contributors can review the contribution they are offering

### Admission

To become a contributor, an existing contributor must secure [majority approval](#majority) in favor of a candidate's application.  When [soliciting votes](#soliciting-votes) for a new contributor application, the soliciting contributor must [communicate](#communications) the addresses [provided by the candidate](#application).

### Resignation

Any contributor may resign as a contributor at any time by [communicating](#communications) their resignation.  When a contributor resigns, all cross-licenses to that contributor terminate, but their cross-licenses to other contributors, as well as any sublicenses they granted, continue.

## Communications

### Equal Information

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive each message sent under these terms.  Any sublicense that entitles any contributor to receive a message must entitle each contributor to receive that message, too.

### Sending

To send a communication under these terms, a contributor must send the message to each other contributor, [retrying](#retry) as necessary.

### Addresses

The first and second contributors must agree on a global, free or low-cost, high-speed, and written communication system, such as e-mail, and provide addresses for that system.  Later contributors must provide addresses for the same system.

### Change of Address

Any contributor may set a new address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communication) the new address from their current address.  Alternatively, any contributor may set a new address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communications) the new address from a different address and securing [supermajority approval](#supermajority), without any opposing message from the address to be replaced.

## Voting

### Equal Vote

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to cast a single, equal vote on each proposal under these terms.  Any sublicense that entitles contributors to vote must entitle all contributors to vote equally.

### Majority

For majority approval, a majority of all responding contributors must vote in favor.

### Supermajority Vote

For supermajority approval, two thirds of all responding contributors must vote in favor.

### Counting

The contributor soliciting approval counts as a contributor responding in favor.

### Deadline

The deadline for approval of any proposal is thirty calendar days from when [votes were first solicited](#soliciting-votes).

### Voting Process

To secure an approval, a contributor must [solicit votes](#soliciting-votes), then [tally votes](#tallying-votes), and finally [report the result](#reporting-results).

### Soliciting Votes

To solicit votes, a contributor must communicate:

1.  the identity of the project

2.  the complete text of the proposal

3.  the voting standard required

4.  the [deadline](#deadline) as a specific date

### Casting Votes

Contributors may vote by replying to a solicitation using the same system of communication.  Messages like "I approve.", "I vote in favor.", and "Aye" indicate a vote in favor.  Messages like "I oppose.", "I vote against.", and "Nay" indicate a vote against.

### Tallying Votes

To tally votes, the contributor who solicited the votes must ensure that each vote message is communicated.  If the communication system enables forwarding messages verbatim, such as by forwarding e-mail, the contributor must forward vote messages verbatim.  If a voting contributor communicates their vote themself, the contributor soliciting votes does not have to communicate it again.

### Reporting Results

To report a result, the contributor who solicited the votes must communicate all the following within seven calendar days after the [deadline](#deadline):

1.  all the information required to [solicit votes](#soliciting-votes)

2.  copies of all [vote messages](#voting)

3.  counts of votes in favor, votes against, and contributors not responding within the [deadline](#deadline)

4.  whether contributors approved the proposal or not

## Payments

### Equal Pay

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive an equal share of license fees for the project.  Any sublicense that entitles any contributor to a payment must require that contribute to pay out equal shares to all other contributors.

### Direct Payment

For direct payment, the one making the payment divides their payment into equal shares and pays each contributor their share directly.

### Indirect Payment

For indirect payment, the one making the payment pays their entire payment to a single contributor, who then divides the total into equal shares and pays each other contributor their share directly.

### Payment Instructions

Any contributor may set new instructions for payment going forward by [communicating](#communication) the new instructions from their current [address](#addresses).

### Process

<!-- TODO: optional payment-handling fee -->

<!-- TODO: net out payment processing fees -->

<!-- TODO: retry, if not responding, redistribute -->

### Distribution

<!-- TODO -->

## Retry

When a [communication](#communications) or [payment](#payments) system fails to deliver a message or payment, the sending contributor must:

1.  [communicate](#communications) the failure and any failure message from the system

2.  wait 48 hours, then send again

3.  if the second attempt fails, [communicate](#communications) the failure and any failure message from the system

On second failure, the contributor is considered to be not responding.

## Amendments

Any contributor may amend these terms by securing [supermajority approval](#supermajority) of amended terms.  Amendments apply from the time of approval going forward, never retroactively.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this project comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to any other contributor for any damages related to this project or these terms, under any kind of legal claim.***
