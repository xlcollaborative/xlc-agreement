# Cross-License Collaborative Agreement

Development Draft

## Purpose

These terms enable contributors working together on a project covered by copyright or patent to make collective decisions about licensing the project as a whole.

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must become a contributor and agree to these terms.  These terms are both strict obligations under an agreement among all agreeing contributors and conditions to all the cross-licenses they receive.

## Cross-Licenses

### Copyright

Each contributor gives a cross-license covering all copyrights in their contributions to this project to each other contributor.

### Patent

Each contributor gives a cross-license for this project covering any patent claims they can license or become able to license to each other contributor.

### Scope

Each cross-license under these terms covers all contributors, past, present, and future, and all contributions submitted to the project, past, present, and future.

### Rights

Cross-licenses under these terms do not give contributors themselves any special permission for the project, only permission to give sublicenses to others.

### Sublicensing

Any contributor may give a sublicense within thirty calendar days of securing [majority approval](#majority).  When [soliciting votes](#soliciting-votes) for a sublicense, a contributor must [communicate](#communications):

1.  identification of the contributor proposing to give the sublicense

2.  an exact copy of all the proposed sublicense terms

3.  identification of the recipient or recipients of the sublicense

4.  a description of any relationship between the contributor proposing to give the sublicense and those who will receive the sublicense or others that will benefit from the sublicense

5.  an exact copy of all the terms of any agreement that has, will, or could pay the contributor proposing to give the sublicense for proposing or securing approval for the sublicense

Contributors may give sublicenses to specific recipients, a categories of recipients, or the public as a whole.  Sublicenses may allow sublicensing in turn.  Sublicenses must apply from the time the sublicense is given, or from a time stated in the terms, not retroactively.

## Contributors

### Qualifications

Only candidates offering to contribute rights to copyrights or patents to the project that would be covered by a cross-license can become contributors.

### Application

To become a contributor, a candidate must provide the following to an existing contributor:

1.  an [address](#addresses) for [communication](#communications) 

2.  [payment instructions](#payment-instructions)

3.  a World Wide Web or other Internet address where contributors can review the contribution they are offering

### Admission

For a candidate to become a contributor, an existing contributor must secure [majority approval](#majority) in favor of a candidate's application.  When [soliciting votes](#soliciting-votes) for an application, the soliciting contributor must [communicate](#communications) the addresses [provided by the candidate](#application).

### Resignation

Any contributor may resign at any time by [communicating](#communications) their resignation.  When a contributor resigns, all cross-licenses to that contributor end, but their cross-licenses to other contributors, as well as any sublicenses they have given, continue.

## Communications

### Equal Information

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive each message sent to any other contributor under these terms.

### Sending Messages

To send a communication under these terms, a contributor must send the message in the English language to each other contributor, [retrying](#retry) as necessary.

### Distributing Messages

Any contributor that receives a message under a sublicense must [communicate](#communication) that message, [retrying](#retrying) as necessary.

### Addresses

The first and second contributors must agree on a global, free or low-cost, high-speed, and electronic communication system, such as e-mail, and provide addresses for that system.  Later contributors must provide addresses for the same system.

### Change of Address

Any contributor may change their address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communications) their new address from their current address.  Alternatively, any contributor may change their address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communications) their new address from a different address and securing [supermajority approval](#supermajority), without any opposing message from the address to be replaced.

## Voting

### Equal Vote

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to cast a single, equal vote on each proposal under these terms.

### Majority

For majority approval, a majority of all responding contributors must vote in favor.

### Supermajority

For supermajority approval, two thirds of all responding contributors must vote in favor.

### Counting

The contributor soliciting approval counts as a contributor voting in favor.

### Deadline

The deadline for approval of any proposal is thirty calendar days from when [votes were first solicited](#soliciting-votes).

### Securing Approval

To secure an approval, a contributor must [solicit votes](#soliciting-votes), then [tally votes](#tallying-votes), and finally [report the result](#reporting-results).

### Soliciting Votes

To solicit votes, a contributor must communicate:

1.  the identity of the project

2.  the complete text of the proposal

3.  the voting standard required

4.  the [deadline](#deadline) as a specific date

### Casting Votes

Contributors may vote by replying to a solicitation using the same system of communication.  Messages like "I approve.", "I vote in favor.", and "Aye" indicate a vote in favor.  Messages like "I oppose.", "I vote against.", and "Nay" indicate a vote against.

### Tallying Votes

To tally votes, the contributor who solicited the votes must ensure that each vote message is communicated.  If the communication system enables forwarding messages verbatim, such as by forwarding e-mail, the contributor must forward vote messages verbatim.  If a voting contributor communicates their vote themself, the contributor soliciting votes does not have to communicate it again.

### Reporting Results

To report a result, the contributor who solicited the votes must communicate all the following within seven calendar days after the [deadline](#deadline):

1.  all the information required to [solicit votes](#soliciting-votes)

2.  copies of all [vote messages](#voting)

3.  counts of votes in favor, votes against, and contributors not responding within the [deadline](#deadline)

4.  whether contributors approved the proposal or not

## Payments

### Equal Pay

Each contributor is entitled to an opportunity to receive an equal share of license fees for the project.  Any sublicense that entitles any contributor to payment must require payment to the contributor that gave the sublicense to start, and to to any successor for which any contributor secures [majority approval](#majority).

### Distributing Payments

Any contributor that receives payment under a sublicense must try to pay other contributors their [equal shares](#equal-pay) of funds received within fourteen calendar days, according to their [payment instructions](#payment-instructions), [retrying](#retry) as necessary.

### Payment Processing Fees

If the [payment instructions](#payment-instructions) of a contributor require the distributing contributor to pay a fee, the contributor making the payment may reduce the amount of the payment by the amount of the fee, so the distributing contributor does not have to pay any processing fees out-of-pocket.

### Failed Payments

If a contributor does not respond to a payment after it is [retried](#retry), the next step depends on the amount of the payment.

If the amount is ten percent or less of the total funds received under the sublicense, or the payment processing fees for distributing the amount would be 50% or more of the amount, then the distributing contributor may keep the amount for themself.

Otherwise, the distributing contributor must try to pay other contributors equal shares of the amount, according to their [payment instructions](#payment-instructions).  The distributing does not have to [retry](#retry) failed those payments.  They can keep failed payments for themself.

### Payment Instructions

Contributors must provide payment instructions for global, low-cost, high-speed, and electronic payment systems.

### Change of Payment Instructions

Any contributor may change their [payment instructions](#payment-instructions) for payments going forward by [communicating](#communication) the new [payment instructions](#payment-instructions) from their current [address](#addresses).

## Retry

When a [communication](#communications) or [payment](#payments) system fails to deliver a message or payment.

1.  The sending contributor must [communicate](#communications) the failure and any failure message from the system.

2.  The sending contributor must wait 48 hours, then send again.  If the receiving contributor [changed](#change-of-address) their [address](#address) or [changed](#change-of-payment instructions) their [payment instructions](#payment-instructions), the sending contributor must honor the change.

3.  If the second try fails, the sending contributor must [communicate](#communications) the failure and any failure message from the system.  The receiving contributor is then considered to be not responding.

## Amendments

Any contributor may amend these terms by securing [supermajority approval](#supermajority) of amended terms.  Amendments apply from the time of approval going forward, never retroactively.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this project comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to any other contributor for any damages related to this project or these terms, under any kind of legal claim.***
