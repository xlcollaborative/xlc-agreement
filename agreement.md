# Cross-License Collaborative Agreement

## Purpose

These terms enable people working together on a project subject to copyright or patents to make collective decisions about licensing of the project as a whole.

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must be invited to become a contributor and agree to these terms as both strict obligations under an agreement among all contributors and conditions to the cross-licenses you receive.

## Cross-Licenses

### Copyright

Each contributor grants a cross-license covering all copyrights in their contributions to this project to each other contributor.

### Patent

Each contributor grants a cross-license for this project covering any patent claims they can license or become able to license to every other contributor.

### Trademark

Each contributor grants a cross-license covering any trademark rights they have in the software to every other contributor.

### Scope

Each cross-license under these terms covers all contributors, past, present, and future, and all contributions submitted to the project, past, present, and future.

### Sublicensing

Contributors can only sublicense according to these terms.  Sublicenses may go to specific licensees, classes of licensees, or the public as a whole.  On granting any sublicense, the sublicensing contributor must [communicate](#communications) all the terms of the sublicense as well as the identity of the licensee.

## Contributors

### Qualifications

Only candidates offering to contribute copyrights or patent rights that would be covered by a cross-license can become contributors.

### Application

To be invited to become a contributor, a candidate must provide an address for [communication](#communications) and an address where contributors can review the contribution they are offering to an existing contributor.

### Approval

Existing contributors approve contributor applications by [vote](#voting).  The initial [voting standard](#voting-standards) for approval is a majority.

### Resignation

Any contributor may [depart](#departure) as a contributor at any time by [communicating](#communications) their resignation to other contributors.

### Departure

When a contributor departs, all cross-licenses to that contributor terminate, but their cross-licenses to other contributors continue.

## Communications

### Sending Communications

To send a communication under these terms, a contributor must send the message to every other contributor at their current address and [retry](#retry) any rejected messages.

### Addresses

Any contributor may set a new address for communication going forward by [communicating](#communication) the new address from their current address.

### Changes

## Voting

### Voting Standards

For a majority, a majority of all responding contributors must approve.  For a supermajority, two thirds of all responding contributors must approve.

### Equal Vote

## Payments

### Equal Pay

### Accounting

### Process

<!-- TODO: net out payment processing fees -->

<!-- TODO: retry, if not responding, redistribute -->

### Distribution

## Retry

When a [communication](#communications) or [payment](#payments) system rejects a message or payment as undeliverable, to an unknown address or account, or the like, the sending contributor must:

1.  [communicate](#communications) the failure and any message from the system

2.  wait 48 hours, then send again

3.  if the second attempt fails, [communicate](#communications) the final failure and any message from the system

On final failure to respond, the contributor is considered to be not responding for the communication or payment.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this project comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this project or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
